# OpenMP-based code parallelization using ChatGPT and Github Copilot

This repository contains code for evaluating the use of ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot for OpenMP-based code parallelization. It includes nine mini-applications, each parallelized manually, using ChatGPT, and using GitHub Copilot. 

### Overview
The repository includes nine OpenMP-parallelized mini-applications that represent diverse workloads from high-performance computing (HPC). The applications test the ability of LLM-based tools to generate correct and performant parallel code.

#### The mini-applications included are:
- Feynman: Uses the Feynman-Kac algorithm to solve Poissonâ€™s equation.
- HotSpot: A thermal simulation.
- Mandelbrot: Calculates an area of the Mandelbrot set.
- MolDyn: A molecular dynamics simulation.
- Nbody: A gravitational n-body interaction simulation.
- PiCalculation: Estimates the value of pi.
- Prime: Calculates prime numbers using a naive algorithm.
- Saxpy: Performs scalar multiplication and vector addition.
- Sgemm: Dense matrix multiplication kernel.
